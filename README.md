# LaneDetect_CarlaSimulator

In this project, a lane detection algorithm has been implemented using Carla Simulator. 
This project implements a real time object detection via video, webcam and image detection using YOLO algorithm. YOLO is a object detection algorithm which stand for You Only Look Once.

Yolo is a deep learning algorythm which came out on may 2016 and it became quickly so popular because itâ€™s so fast compared with the previous deep learning algorythm. With yolo we can detect real time objects at a relatively high speed. With a GPU we would be able to process over 45 frames/second while with a CPU around a frame per second.


OpenCV dnn module supports running inference on pre-trained deep learning models from popular frameworks like Caffe, Torch and TensorFlow.
